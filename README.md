# Rare Server: The Publishing Platform for the Discerning Writer

## Project Overview:
Rare Publishing is a Full-Stack group project with collaboration from students in Cohort 60 of Nashville Software School.

Rare Publishing was built in two sprints, with this repo being the second iteration of the backend app. It was first built with [Python](https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-60/rare-python-server-tyrannical-tators) only and then rebuilt here using Django REST Framework. This repo works with the current client code available [here](https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-60/rare-client-tenacious-tators).


## Primary Features:
The Goal of this web app is to allow authors to create blogposts.
Authors can also view other's blogposts and their own in list form as well as in detail.
They can edit and delete if they no longer like their blogposts.
They can also create and delete categories that they can then assign to a blogpost, blogposts can be viewed by category.
Tags can be created, edited, and deleted by any author and any user has the ability to create, edit, and delete their own comments.
Users can react to blogposts using predetermined emojis that keep a running count of reactions to that specific post.
Users can subscribe and unsubscribe to other users/authors.


## Target Audience:
People who want to share ideas, opinions, topics, thoughts, and current events.


## Purpose and problems it solves:
It's a mutual space for anyone that wants to share and read other's ideas.
Instead of searching Google you can now go to this site to read opinions(totally not like Twitter or Facebook).
